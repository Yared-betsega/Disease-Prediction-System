# Disease-Prediction-System

## Introduction
It might have happened so many times that you or
someone yours need doctor’s help immediately, but
they are not available due to some reasons.The
Disease Prediction system is an end user support
and online consultation project. Here, we propose a
web application that allow users to get instant
guidance on their disease through an intelligent
system.

**Q: What does this project do?**

The application is fed with various details
and the disease associated with those
details. The application allows users to
share their disease-related issues. It then
processes user-specified details to check for
various illnesses that could be associated
with it. Here we use some intelligent data
mining techniques to guess the most
accurate illness that could be associated
with the patient’s details. Based on result,
patient can contact doctors accordingly for
further treatment.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to
create a platform which uses
machine learning to predict the
patient's disease based on the
symptoms provided. This system
can be really useful to assist
physicians as well as patients to
predict diseases based on the
symptoms of the patient which
minimizes their mistakes and
increases the chance of the
disease being identified correctly.
A platform as such can be really
useful in the health sector in that
it helps patients get the help they
need and doctors in their desision
making which in turn helps save
a lot of lifes.
