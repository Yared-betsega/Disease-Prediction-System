<h1>Disease-Prediction-System</h1>
<div>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p align = "justify">
  It might have happened so many times that you or
  someone yours need doctor’s help immediately, but
  they are not available due to some reasons.The
  Disease Prediction system is an end user support
  and online consultation project. Here, we propose a
  web application that allow users to get instant
  guidance on their disease through an intelligent
  system.</p><br>

  **Q: What does this project do?**

  <p align = "justify">The application is fed with various details
  and the disease associated with those
  details. The application allows users to
  share their disease-related issues. It then
  processes user-specified details to check for
  various illnesses that could be associated
  with it. Here we use some intelligent data
  mining techniques to guess the most
  accurate illness that could be associated
  with the patient’s details. Based on result,
  patient can contact doctors accordingly for
  further treatment. </p>

  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p align = "justify">The purpose of this project is to
  create a platform which uses
  machine learning to predict the
  patient's disease based on the
  symptoms provided. This system
  can be really useful to assist
  physicians as well as patients to
  predict diseases based on the
  symptoms of the patient which
  minimizes their mistakes and
  increases the chance of the
  disease being identified correctly.
  A platform as such can be really
  useful in the health sector in that
  it helps patients get the help they
  need and doctors in their desision
  making which in turn helps save
  a lot of lifes.</p>

  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Django to build the back-end of the website</li>
    <li>python for writing the machine learning algorithms</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS and JavasScript to build the front-end of the Application</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL for the relational database management system</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Before starting to use the platform, The user needs to create an account to identify whether the user is a patient, a doctor, or an admin.</li>
    <li>
      After successful authentication
      <ul>
        <li>If the user is a patient, he/she is redirected to the home page where they will be presented with a screen to choose simptoms and get their predicted disease.</li>
        <li>If the user is a doctor, he/she is redirected to their profile page and can see their history and can give feedback.</li>
        <li>If the user is an admin, he/she is redirected to the page where they can chose to either manage the users' data or view user's feedback</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
